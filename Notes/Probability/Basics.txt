Permutation vs Combination 
== 
Permutations
    order matters 
        AABB != ABAB 
    Simply n! 
Combinations
    order doesn't matter 
    AABB == ABAB 
    n! / (r!(n-r)!) where n is how many youre selecting r from n options 
    
Relation of Two Events 
== 
Simple Rules 
    And means multiply 
    Or means add 
Disjoint
    Two events are disjoint if mutually exclusive 
    If events are disjoint, or can be calculated simply P(AvB) = P(A) + P(B) 
    If they aren't, must remove overlap P(AvB) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A^B)
Indepdendent 
    Two events are independent if they do not influence each other 
    You can use the simple multiply rule on indepdendent events P(A^B) = P(A)P(B)
    If they're not indepdendent, they must be addressed with conditional probability 
    
Compliment 
== 
For answering probability questions using "at least" 
It's often easier to subtract that you don't get at least as many as specified 
    P(A) + P(not A) = 1 -> 1 - P(not A) = P(A)

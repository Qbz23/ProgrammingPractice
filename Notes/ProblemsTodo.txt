Given a grid, how would you find the nearest N poitns to a point of interest?
What if the grid and N can can be arbitrarily large? 
How might spatial partitions help? 

Write a fx to draw a line on a texture backed by a 1d array 
where each uint8 represents 8 pixels, each pixel being a bit. 
Line is horizontal. given w/h and line start and line length 

Write a function to rotate an image backed by a 1d array 90 degrees clockwise 

Given a mesh with arbitrary mixed polygon sizes snf s buffer of polygon sizes to interpret vertices/indices, 
return the indices of a triangulated mesh

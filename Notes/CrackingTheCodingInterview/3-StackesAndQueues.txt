Stack Notes 
==
Last In, First Out 
Typically implements Pop, Push, Peek/Top, and IsEmpty 
Often useful in recursive algorithms 
- Push data onto the stack as you recurse 
- Pop it off the stack as you backtrack 
Can be used to implement recursive algorithms iteratively 

Queue Notes 
==
First In, First Out
Same typical methods as stack 
Often used in breadth-first search or implementing a cache

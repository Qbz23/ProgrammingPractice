6-3 Dominos 
==
Given 31 dominios, each covering 2 squares, can the entire 8x8 board be covered? 
Prove your answer by giving an example or showing why it's impossible 

Initial Solution
==
There's no problem with the 8 wide rows, the 7 wide rows add the problem 
The only real way tp solve a 7 wide row is to make the adjacent row 7 wide 
|------X
|------|
|------|
|------|
|------|
|------|
!------|
X------! 
So yeah it look like it doesn't work. 
If it were 8x9 with a few extra dominos it would work 
Can generally say it wont fit on even rows. Say 4x4 
|--X
|--|
!--|
X--! 
But 4x5 would be fine 
|--X
|--|
|--|
|--|
X--|
No alternate configuration of dominos is relevant 
They ultimately have to make their neighbor's width 7 
The row straddling piece alternates sides down the board 
A   X
A   B
C   B
C   D
X   D
The odd variations work because the final side piece does not 
conflict with the blocked corner 

Book Solution 
== 
Provides a proof of why it's impossible 
  The board initially has 32 black and 32 white squares 
  Remove opposite corners (which necessarily are the same color)
  30 black squares and 32 white squares 
  Each domino must take up 1 black square and 1 white square 
  30 black squares is insufficient to contain 31 dominos 
Consistent with initial solution odd row count observation in that 
having odd rows would make the corners have different colors

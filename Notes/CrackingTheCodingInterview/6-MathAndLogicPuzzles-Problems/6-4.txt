6-4 Ants on a Triangle 
==
Ant on tri vertices. Probability of collision between any two if they pick a 
random direction and walk down the sides of the triangle? 

Initial Solution 
== 
The only scenario where they don't collide is all going in same direction 
Both of those scenarios ("left" and "right") are (1/2)^3 
No collision then is 2(1/2)^3 which is 0.25 
Any collisio is 1 - no collision so it's therefore 0.75

Book Solution 
== 
Same solution but also notes its generalizable to an N dimensional polygon with 
  1 - 2(1/2)^N 
  1 - (1/2)^(N-1)

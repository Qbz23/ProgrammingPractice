6-5 Jugs of Water 
==
5q jug, 3q jug, and unlimited water. How do you get exactly 4q water? 
Precisely filling up half (or some fraction) of the jug is impossible 

Initial Solution 
== 
The typical idea of this sort of problem is you can acquire other quantities 
by pouring one jug into another 
For example, fill 5q, pour it into 3q, 2q remains in 5q jug 
To "advance" towards new possible outcomes, you need to use your new quantities 
Fill 5q 
Pour 5q into 3q, 2q remaining 
Can't do anything else with this state, need to dump a jug. Dump 3q.
Now have 0/3q and 2/5q, move the 2 into 3q -> 2/3q and 0/5q
Can't lose 2q, so the only thing to do is fill 5q -> 2/3q and 5/5q 
Can now take advantage of the remaining space in 3q, there is only 1q remaining. 
Therefore if fill remainder of 3q from the 5q, we're left with 4q   

Book Solution 
== 
Same solution, but also notes if two jug sizes are relatively prime, you 
can measure any value between 1 and the sum of their sizes

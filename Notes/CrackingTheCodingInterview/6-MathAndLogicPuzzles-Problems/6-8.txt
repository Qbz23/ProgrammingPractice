6-8 Egg Drop 
==
100 Floor building, if egg dropped from nth floor or above, breaks 
Given 2 eggs, find N while minimizing drops for the worst case 

Initial Solution
==
The problem seemingly suggests binary search but there is a bit of a twist 
Cannot fail to find the lowest floor, so must be more careful with the second egg 
Start with the 50th floor, 
If it breaks, you'd want to go the 25th but you can't, you have to go the first 
If it doesn't break, go to the 75th 
Similarly, on break, need to drop down to the bottom of your range 
That will give you a solution but it seems like too many drops 
This seems like an opportunity to shift the worst case 
Say we instead start at 25, worst case is now 25 drops 
If it doesnt break, bisect the upper range which would be 52 
The worst case would be a break here, which would require counting up from 26
This leads to maybe 26 drops
This is better than previous binary search case that could require up to 50 
So this shows that the bottom of the range should be prioritized to reduce the worst case. 
Going to stop here, hopefully the book can move from a slight worst case reduction to a truly optimal stragey

Book Solution
==
Proposes naive solution of starting at 10th floor then 20th, etc 
This leads to at most 19 drops total, already better than my solutions 
If the egg breaks on floor 10, 10 drops worst case. Else, 19 drops worst case. 
We want to make these two possibilites more equal in terms of drops 
    A perfect system would be one in which Drops(E1) == Drops(E2), for any Drops(E1)
    Each drop of e1 advances the range up, allowing one fewer floor for e2 
    We must therefore, reduce steps required by e2 by one drop each time. 
        Ex. E1 dropped on 20 then 30, e2 req up to 9 steps. 
        Next e2 drop must reduce potential e2 steps to 8
        To do this, drop e1 at 39 
    Therefore, if X is starting floor, X must go up by (X-1),(X-2), etc
    X + (X - 1) + (X - 2) ... + 1 = 100 
    (X(X + 1))/2 = 100 
    X = 13.65
    Round up, cant round down, it wont cover the whole range 
    X = 14
    You can generalize 100 to number of floors

Anything that you had to look up while solving a problem should go here. 
Also any "knowledge" type questions that aren't explictly coding

Vectors

Push vs Emplace Back 
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4303513/push-back-vs-emplace-back
  See Other/EmplaceTest.cpp for example. It seems to me the worst calling 
  pattern is passing a constructed temp. Passing a local is ok to both push 
  back and emplace back. One ctor for temp, then one operator= for putting it 
  in the container. The best calling pattern is passing variadic args which 
  constructs the object in place in the container. This requires only one 
  construction. 
 
Stack 
=
Calling top on an empty stack leads to undefined behavior.
